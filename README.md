# Project: Image Captioning

In this project, we build a deep learning neural network based on the following paper:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf.

We design a CNN-RNN model for automatically generating image captions.

Giving images, the captions were automatically generated. The predicted captions for sample images that were in many cases quite accurate.
